# ✈️ Airline Booking System – Python Case Study

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Python-based Airline Booking System** developed as an academic case study. It demonstrates how core programming concepts can be applied to solve a real-world problem using a **menu-driven, console application**.

The system allows users to view flight details, explore seat layouts, book and cancel tickets, view real-time price breakdowns, and analyze revenue data. The project focuses on clean code structure, modular design, and beginner-friendly implementation.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Design a simple airline booking system using Python
* Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
* Implement dynamic ticket pricing
* Visualize seat layouts using NumPy
* Store booking and revenue data persistently using CSV files
* Generate revenue reports and charts

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
* **NumPy** – Seat layout visualization
* **Pandas** – Revenue analysis
* **Matplotlib** – Revenue charts
* **CSV File Handling** – Persistent data storage
